Calculating Prime Numbers using Sieve of Eratosthenes
 The Sieve of Eratosthenes seems to be an simple  and efficient algorithm to calculate prime numbers upto 10 million or so(why the limit idk)
 but I was looking for an efficient algo as calculating prime upto a big number makes chrome page unresponsive.
